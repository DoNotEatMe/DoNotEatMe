Hi, I'm Igor. Nice to meet you here.

Since 2017, I've been working in the gaming industry. I started in customer support and eventually progressed to the position of team lead in marketing. Most of my work has revolved around the publishing of PC/Console games, giving me diverse experience in both social and technical aspects of publishing.

In 2023, I made the decision to transition my career to become a UE C++ developer, a dream I've had since I was younger. Here, I'm compiling test cases I've created myself to showcase my experience in C++ and UE.
